Ace: (Boy am I nervous!)
Boss: Ace!
Ace: [blink] Oh, h-hiya, Boss.
Boss: Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Ace, I'm impressed! 
Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.
Ace: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.
Boss: A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?
Ace: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.
Boss: Well, that's news to me!
Ace: I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.
???: (It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)
Boss: ... Isn't that your client screaming over there?
Ace: Yeah... that's him.
???: (Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)
Boss: It sounds like he wants to die...
Ace: Um, yeah. *sigh* 
Bingo: Ace!!!
Ace: Hey. Hey there, Barry.
Bingo: Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!
Ace: What!? What's wrong, Barry?
Bingo: Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Ace? Who did this!? 
Aww, Ace, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?
Ace: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say [sound clue] it was you...)

Ace: My name is Ace Detective. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. 
The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Barry Bingo... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Bingo." 
In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. 
He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. 
That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!
