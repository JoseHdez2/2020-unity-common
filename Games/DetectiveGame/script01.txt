Ace: (Boy am I nervous!)
Boss: Ace!
Ace: Oh, h-hiya, Boss.
Boss: Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Ace, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.
Ace: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.
Boss: A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?
Ace: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.
Boss: Well, that's news to me!
Ace: I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.
???: (It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)
Boss: ... Isn't that your client screaming over there?
Ace: Yeah... that's him.
???: (Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)
Boss: It sounds like he wants to die...
Ace: Um, yeah. *sigh*
